    * \* 9.00am – 12.00pm Morning hike through the Sanctuary’s rainforest & elephant discovery walk. We begin with a short scenic hike into the valley. Before meeting the elephants, our guide, will explain the project goals & the importance of protecting Mondulkiri’s wildlife & habitats. Next, we’ll meet, greet, feed and follow the elephants & their mahouts (elephant care takers) as they freely walk and eat in the jungle. We will follow them to observe the elephants’ natural behaviors for example the way in which they consume bamboo, grasses and different plant roots as natural medicine. This is an ideal opportunity to take lots of photos of the elephants enjoying life in their natural environment.
    * \* 12.00 – 2.00pm Lunch at the visitor jungle sweet home:  Time to hike to the Sanctuary’s visitor our jungle sweet home, which is located by the river to enjoy a local food. Following lunch, you can relax in a hammock while enjoying the wild jungle views. It may be possible to spot birds & other wildlife in this area and swimming at our beautiful waterfall.
    * \* 2:00 – 3:00 Elephant bath & water fun:  In the afternoon, we hike back into the forest & make our way to the Sanctuary’s natural river pool. The mahouts will slowly walk the elephants into the water, for their daily shower & mud bath. The elephants love grooming each other, scratching against trees and playing in the mud.- Swimming with the elephants is an unforgettable experience and can be messy! Mud coating is important in order to keep an elephant’s skin moist, protected, and healthy.
    * \* 3:00 - 4.00pm After saying goodbye to the elephants & the Sanctuary team, you will hike out of the forest back to the truck and drive to the Bunong minority village (Putang). Once at the village, you will receive a warm welcome by the villagers and are free to walk around the Bunong traditional houses to gain an insight into their village life.
